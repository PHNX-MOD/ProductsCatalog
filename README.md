# ProductsCatalog

It’s a simple REST API for a catalog of products. The application contains:
● Product categories;
● Products which belong to some category (one product may belong to one category);

● The application is written in Python language using Django/Rest framework.
● command "python3 manage.py runserver" or "python3 manage.py runserver" in the terminal to run the application in the localhost (path: /ProductsCatalog$ python3 manage.py runserver ). Localhost as the home, 127.0.0.1:8000/products/categories will be routed to appropriate ViewSet and further actions.
● The UnitTests are incomplete.
